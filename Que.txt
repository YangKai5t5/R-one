1 =  reverse digits of given number.
2 =  Count occurrence of alphabets in a given sentence.
3 =  Reverse String,
4 =  Find the frequency of characters from the given string
5 =  if a number if a power of 7
6 =  clock problem
7 =  Find the kth highest element in an array
8 =  Find the angle made by hour and minute at a given specific time
9 =  Write code for the angle between the "Minute hand" and "hour hand".
10 = find unique element in array using O(n) time and O(1) space complexity.
11 = second highes number without sorting
12 = two sum prolem
13 = valid parenthesis
14 = Hourglass problem
15 = First non-repeating character from a string
16 = find the second largest element in array
17 = Detect loop in linked list
18 = They give you number and add that number until the it less than 9
19 = fibonaci series, second smallest number, quick sort
20 = find second max in array. Robot path.
21 = Paranthesis checker, Second max element, longest window of 1's
22 = Find the nearest prime number to a given number
23 = Find the second minimum value from an array
24 = Sum of digits of the given number
25 = replace space with %20 in string.
26 = Find the next prime number of given number
27 = Program to find non-repeating characters from string
28 = write a code to inverse a string without any inbuilt functions
27 = print 2324 as 2000 300 20 4
28 = puzzle- GFG horse coding
29 = Implement the below function to print the frequency of non-vowels (characters which are NOT a, e, i, o, u) in a given string and also print the count of vowels. (Ignore the character cases, it can be lower or upper case) The function will take 1 parameter which will be a String (or a character array). You do not have to write code to get the input parameter from the user. int frequencyOfNonVowels(String input) { if(input) } Example: Input: rajasoft Output: r=1, j=1, s=1, f=1, t=1, vowels=3 Input: Buffet Output: b=1, f=2, t=1, vowels=2
30 = Write a function that takes an input parameter as a String. The function should reverse the statement but keep the words intact and print it. Words are separated by dots. (Avoid using inbuilt functions) If input is “i.like.this.program.very.much” Output will be “much.very.program.this.like.i
31 = Write a function which takes an input parameter as an array of integers and prints the sum of all prime numbers from the given array. If all integers present in the input array are non-prime the program should print sum as 0. Example: Input1: [1, 14, 5, 7] Output: sum=12 Input2: [2, 10, 13, 9] Output: sum=15
32 = Write a program to merge two lists by alternatively taking elements from each list. The method will take 2 arrays as input and return the merged array as output. Input: [1,2,3] and [a,b,c] Output: [1,a,2,b,3,c] Input: [1,2,3,4,5] and [a,b,c] Output: [1,a,2,b,3,c,4,5] Input: [1,2,3] and [a,b,c,d,e] Output: [1,a,2,b,3,c,d,e]
33 = Variation of Fibonacci The Fibonacci sequence is constructed by adding the last two numbers of the sequence so far to get the next number in the sequence. The first and the second numbers of the sequence are defined as 0 and 1. We get: 0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21… Write a function which takes input as a number: If the given number is a Fibonacci number, print the number If the given number is NOT a Fibonacci number, print the sum of all even Fibonacci numbers less than the given number. int getFibOutput(int input) { // TODO: } Example (21 is a Fibonacci number) Input: 21 Output: 21 (20 is NOT a Fibonacci number so, output is 10 (2+8)) Input: 20 Output: 10
34 = Buy and sell stocks. - Balance parenthesis string. - Hour and minute hand problem
